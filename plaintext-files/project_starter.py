# TODO 6: Write the sales data (the list of lists) to a new CSV file called "product_sales.csv"
    # TODO 6.1: Open the CSV file in write mode
    # Hint: Use the 'open' function with the mode parameter set to 'w', and the newline parameter set to an empty string.


    # TODO 6.2: Create a CSV writer object
    # Hint: Use the 'writer' method of the 'csv' library.


    # TODO 6.3: Write appropriate headers to the CSV file
    # Hint: The 'writerow' method of the CSV writer can be used to write a row to the CSV file.


    # TODO 6.5: Write the sales data (i.e., the list of lists) to the CSV file
    # Hint: The 'writerows' method of the CSV writer can be used to write multiple rows to the CSV file at one time.
